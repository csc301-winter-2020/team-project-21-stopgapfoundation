Instructions to set up the Django environment locally

1. Install python3 and python3-venv
    ex. sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv

2. Create a virtual environment for this project
    ex. python3 -m venv stopgap_venv
        - Run this command in the folder in which you want the new python shell executable to be created

3. Source the $VENV_HOME/bin/activate file created from step 2

4. Use pip to install django and djangorestframework
    ex. pip install django djangorestframework

5. This command is used to create a new Django project:
    (IMPORTANT: Don't run this again in our project's folder, it will rewrite our files)

    django-admin start project stopgap-project

6. This command is used to create a new app within our Django project:

    django-admin start app order_manager
