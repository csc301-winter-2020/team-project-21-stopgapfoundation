Instructions to set up the Django environment locally

1. Install python3 and python3-venv
    ex. sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv

2. Create a virtual environment for this project
    ex. python3 -m venv stopgap_venv
        - Run this command in the folder in which you want the new python shell executable to be created

3. Source the $VENV_HOME/bin/activate file created from step 2

4. Use pip to install django, djangorestframework, Pillow
    ex. pip install django djangorestframework Pillow

5. Command to create a new Django project:
    (IMPORTANT: Don't run this again in our project's folder, it will rewrite our files)

    django-admin startproject stopgap_project .

6. Command to create a new app within our Django project:

    django-admin start app <app_name>

    Current apps:
        - order_manager

7. Command to make migrations (create commands to update database tables to match our Django models):

    python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>

8. Command to apply migrations to database (actually apply the migration commands from step 7):

    python manage.py migrate

9. Command to run local Django server:

    python manage.py runserver


Other commands:

- Create a superuser for development purposes:

    python manage.py createsuperuser --email <email address> --username <username>

    Note: Keep track of superusers and delete them before production

- Test an http request through the command line, with a Django server running locally

    # Install httpie
    ex. sudo apt-get install httpie

    # http request command
    http -a <username>:<password> <url>
