# StopGap Foundation / Team 21


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect 

 * When: Monday March 9
 * Where: In-class tutorial

 There has also been communication online between the team about the process

## Process - Reflection 


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

1. The Kanban Agile Framework

Our use of the Kanban framework for organization was successful. Since many of us were busy with other school commitments, it was unreasonable to use a more rigid framework, as many of us wouldn't be able to make the commitments that such a method would require. Kanban, being very loose, allowed us to still work on the project, while being able to tend to our other commitments reasonably.

2. Communication Methods

Using Discord for voice meetings, and Facebook messenger for text communication, was also a decision that turned out well. We were all reasonably active on messenger, so information was communicated to all members quickly and consistently. While some members were unfamiliar with discord at first, it’s voice communication functions ended up being very easy to learn, so all members were able to participate in online meetings.

3. GitHub Organization

The decision to have individual branches, made on deliverable 1, in question 8, definitely worked out favourably for the group. Since work was able to be split up into relatively isolated chunks, the ability for each group member to focus on the specific work they needed to complete without worrying about the action of other group members was very helpful for ensuring work got done.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Meeting Timings

Instead of the weekly group meetings that we intended on having, we were just communicating through Facebook Messenger. The decision to have weekly group meetings was largely unsuccessful because as a group we had so many other assignments to complete that we could not always have a good time for the full group to meet. There would be a few members missing and just having communication on a basis of availability was more useful for our group.

2. Wanting to Use Docker to Assist in Deployment

We initially intended on using Docker to deploy the project along with Heroku, but we found out that we could only have one Docker container inside the Heroku project, making the process of deployment much more difficult. There were also some issues having docker work consistently on all group members machines, so we decided to move to just using django with heroku for the deployment set up, making it easier for the entire group to use.

3. Wanting to Use A CI/CD Pipeline

We initially planned on using Circle-CI for our pipeline for the project, however we realized that it would not be free for what we needed, similarly looking through the CI/CD integrated in Heroku. Thus we decided to not usre a CI/CD piplele for the assignment, our deployment is done through one script and we will insure that it is properly done every time we need to make a change to our deployed application.


#### Q3. Planned changes

1. Strict Deadlines

Easily the biggest change we need to make is to start setting and enforcing stricter deadlines for work. This deliverable, we didn’t make much progress over the reading week, and due to many group members having other school commitments in the following weeks, a lot of work ended up getting pushed to the last minute. This is obviously something we don’t wish to repeat, so to rectify this we will start allocating work earlier and setting earlier deadlines.

2. Accurate Communication

Another planned change will be to better communicate what work has been done in the master branch, and why, to the rest of the group. We had an incident where some work was done by one person, but the rest of the group didn’t know what the function of this work was. This took some time to resolve, so we would like to avoid this situation going forward.

3. Meeting Scheduling

We also plan on improving how we organize group meetings Currently, we plan meetings very last minute, which can of course impact how many of us can attend each meeting, as last minute commitments are difficult to plan around. In order to ensure maximum group participation in meetings we will schedule them earlier.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

To prepare for our demo, our team organized a group meeting during the tutorial session. Usually we split half the session reviewing where we are and the second half on critical meetings. During weeks of our demo we used that time to review what we had to demo and indicate who was available to present it. 

For our first demo, we created a set of wireframes for the layout of our application and sent those to our partner. We decided to email our partner the wireframes so our partner and their team could provide thoughtful feedback. Choosing to email our demo had this advantage over showing them in-person which would provide rushed feedback. With our partner’s feedback, we decided that a messaging system between a client and an admin was meaningless to the focus of the application. As a result, we scrapped the idea and pushed without it for D2. Also, we received feedback on the workflow for our application. Our partner suggested a better way to position views in our application. Our second demo consisted of us showcasing our front-end design for the project and its workflow. Our partner was generally very accepting of our design which matched the wireframes from demo 1. 

The feedback from our partner provided us a greater understanding of where the ramp request team was coming from and how they would go on-to use our application. In terms of the process, we learn that despite multiple conversations about vision of what the project will be, there will always be some differences in exactly the features that are wanted, and where exactly they should be. This teaches us that consistent, strong communication is key for the team to create the ideal product for the partner.
