## Process - Reflection 


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

1. The Kannab Agile Framework
Our use of the Kanban framework for organization was successful. Since many of us were busy with other school commitments, it was unreasonable to use a more rigid framework, as many of us wouldn't be able to make the commitments that such a method would require. Kanban, being very loose, allowed us to still work on the project, while being able to tend to our other commitments reasonably.

2. Communication Methods
Using Discord for voice meetings, and Facebook messenger for text communication, was also a decision that turned out well. We were all reasonably active on messenger, so information was communicated to all members quickly and consistently. While some members were unfamiliar with discord at first, it’s voice communication functions ended up being very easy to learn, so all members were able to participate in online meetings.

3. GitHub Organization
The decision to have individual branches, made on deliverable 1, in question 8, definitely worked out favourably for the group. Since work was able to be split up into relatively isolated chunks, the ability for each group member to focus on the specific work they needed to complete without worrying about the action of other group members was very helpful for ensuring work got done.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Meeting Timings
Instead of the weekly group meetings that we intended on having, we were just communicating through Facebook Messenger. The decision to have weekly group meetings was largely unsuccessful because as a group we had so many other assignments to complete that we could not always have a good time for the full group to meet. There would be a few members missing and just having communication on a basis of availability was more useful for our group.

2. Wanting to Use Docker to Assist in Deployment
We initially intended on using Docker to deploy the project along with Heroku, but we found out that we could only have one Docker container inside the Heroku project, making the process of deployment much more difficult. There were also some issues having docker work consistently on all group members machines, so we decided to move to just using django with heroku for the deployment set up, making it easier for the entire group to use.


#### Q3. Planned changes

1. Strict Deadlines
Easily the biggest change we need to make is to start setting and enforcing stricter deadlines for work. This deliverable, we didn’t make much progress over the reading week, and due to many group members having other school commitments in the following weeks, a lot of work ended up getting pushed to the last minute. This is obviously something we don’t wish to repeat, so to rectify this we will start allocating work earlier and setting earlier deadlines.

2. Accurate Communication
Another planned change will be to better communicate what work has been done in the master branch, and why, to the rest of the group. We had an incident where some work was done by one person, but the rest of the group didn’t know what the function of this work was. This took some time to resolve, so we would like to avoid this situation going forward.

3. Meeting Scheduling
We also plan on improving how we organize group meetings Currently, we plan meetings very last minute, which can of course impact how many of us can attend each meeting, as last minute commitments are difficult to plan around. In order to ensure maximum group participation in meetings we will schedule them earlier.
